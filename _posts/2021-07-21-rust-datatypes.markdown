Rust is a statically typed language. That means, all the variables should have a data type associate with them in the compile time. In some cases, Rust will infer the data types from variable values. But if more than one data type is possible for value, then the compiler will force the developer to explicitly assign the data type for the variable.

Below is the list of data types available in Rust

- Integer
- Boolean
- Char
- Floating-point number
- Tuple
- Array

### Integer

The integer data type is used for storing signed and an unsigned integer values. Signed means the number has Negative or positive signs associated with them.For example -10, -2, +20 are signed integer.Normally we will use a sign, only for a negative number. if the integer does not has any sign then that is considered as a positive integer. For signed and unsigned integers we have separate data types.

#### Signed Integer

Signed integers can store positive and negative integers. The below code example has different signed integer data types

```rs
fn main() {
    let a: i8 = 10;
    let b: i16 = -20;
    let c: i32 = 10;
    let d: i64 = 20;
    let e: i128 = 30;
    let f: isize = -40;
}
```

All the signed integer data types are a combination of **i** and space it can take. For **i8** integer will take up to 8-bit space, **i16** it takes up to 16-bit space, and so on. The last data type, **isize** means it take space based on the system architecture. For example, if you have a 32-bit machine, it will take up to 32-bit space. If you have a 64-bit machine it will take up to 64-bit space.

if you did not mention any data type for integer Rust will assign default data type **i32**. For example, in the below code block the data type for the variable **a** will be inferred as **i32**.

```rs
fn main() {
    let a = 10;
}
```

#### Unsigned integer

Unsigned integers can store only positive integers. The below code example has a different unsigned integer data type

```rs
fn main() {
    let a: u8 = 10;
    let b: u16 = 20;
    let c: u32 = 10;
    let d: u64 = 20;
    let e: u128 = 30;
    let f: usize = 40;
}
```

All unsigned integers data types are a combination of **u** and the bit space it can take. Unsigned integers have bit space the same as singed integers, from 8 to 128 bit and size which will take bit space based on system architecture.

### Boolean

The boolean data type can store values either True or False. This data type is mostly used as a flag. For example, we can use boolean as below

```rs
fn main() {
    let a = true;
    let b: bool = false;
}
```

### Char

Char data type used for storing single letter. You can't store more than one letter in char data type. For that, we have to use string data type. We will learn about string data type in a separate post. In char data type you can store all valid Unicode characters.

```rs
fn main() {
    let a = 'a';
    let b: char = 'ðŸ˜Š';
}
```

### Floating-point number

Floating point number used for store number with decimal points.For example 1.3 or 3.14. Below is the example code

```rs
fn main() {
    let a = 1.3;
    let b: f64 = 3.14;
    let c: f32 = -3.14;
}
```

### Tuple

All the above data types we learned are called **scalar data types**. Tuple and Array data types are called **compound data types**. The difference between scalar and Compound data types is scalar data types can hold a single value, but compound data types can have more than one value per variable. Will see Tuple first.

```rs
fn main() {
    let a = (10, "Test", 1.3);
    let b: (u32, f64) = (10, 3.14);
}
```

A tuple can hold multiple values with different data types. We can access the individual values from a tuple by destructuring or using dot (.) as shown below.

```rs
fn main() {
    let a = (10, "Test", 1.3);
    let b: (u32, f64) = (10, 3.14);
    let (c, d, e) = a;
    println!("{}", a.0);
}
```

**_let (c, d, e) = a_** in this code we are breaking the tuple into individual values and assign to the variables. After this, we can use this variable c,d,e like any other variable. **_println!("{}", a.0);_** In this code we are accessing the tuple value by its index. **_a.0_** will return the first value from the tuple.

### Array

Array similar to the tuple, it can hold multiple values. But array requires all the values are in the same data type. Like tuple, we can't put different types of data types in an array.

```rs
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let b = [3; 5];
    let c = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
}
```

In the above example **a** is an array containing five i32 values. As we learn before, these variable data types should be the same. In the next line, we are creating a new array with five values all are 3. This line is same as writing **_let b = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];_**. On the third line, we have an array with all values are in char data type.

We can access the array value using the index of the value.

```rs
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let b = [3; 5];
    let c = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
    println!("{}", a[0]);
    println!("{}", b[2]);
}
```

The above two compound data types are fixed lengths. That means once we declare this variable we can't grow or shrink the variable size. For that type of use case, we have another data type called **vector**. We will learn about the vector data type in a separate post.

**if you have any doubt or suggestions please comment. I will address them.**
